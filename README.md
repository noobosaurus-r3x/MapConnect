# MapConnect

**MapConnect** is a single‑page web tool that lets you drop GPS points on an interactive Leaflet map and see basic stats.

## What it does

Add points – click on the map or enter latitude/longitude and press Add point.

Edit points – drag markers to fine‑tune their position.

Path display – lines connect points in the order added; an option closes the path to the first point.

Stats panel – live count of points and connecting lines.

Client‑side only – no backend, no data stored.
